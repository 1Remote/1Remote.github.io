## About me

![avatar](./img/author_avatar.jpg)

Hi there,

I’m Shawn. the author of {{appname}}. I’m a software developer from China, a big fan of remote desktop software, user of C++/C/C#/Python/Pytorch/Go/typescript. I’m also a big fan of open source software. I hope that 1Remote can help you manage your remote connections well and find this app useful.  If you would like to support my work, you can buy me a coffee or give a nice review. Thanks!
