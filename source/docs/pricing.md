!!! note
    - The exe version of 1Remote on GitHub is **completely free** for personal use.
    - For Microsoft Store build, you may need to pay for a lifetime license.
    - We will give away free lifetime license for some special events.
    - For commercial use, I am not currently considering charging for commercial licensing of 1Remote, so you can use it in your company, but I will not provide any support for commercial use.

All features are available on all this versions. *Microsoft Store version may introduce some unique new features in the future.*
